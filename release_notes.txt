elk-6.2.8 interface notes

update 1:

Introduced a new input flag called "wanind". When set to .true. in elk.in,
the user has to input the upper and lower band indices for the correlated
energy window. These indices are input in the last line of the "wanproj"
input flag instead of the energy window bounds.

 orbitals and occupation numbers are written to EVECSV.OUT and OCCSV.OUT,
 respectively

 the code crashes when generating species files; both problems are now fixed

 version 2
-gauge invariant current density plots in 2D and 3D now available (tasks 372 and

 temperature Matsubara implementation; currently it only calculates the k-point
 resolved spectral function on the real axis; see the 'examples/GW' directory

 equivalents; MF added to list of contributors

 functionals, see: L. Ortenzi, I. I. Mazin, P. Blaha, and L. Boeri,
 Phys. Rev. B 86, 064437 (2012); use the parameter `rstsf´ to adjust the spin
 scaling

elk-3.3.15
-lots of optimisations of both speed and memory; many tasks should be noticeably
 faster
-added new 'robust adaptive mixer' (mixtype=4) which should be able to converge
 almost anything; there are no mixing parameters for this mixer; useful for
 materials searches when you have to be guaranteed convergence; slower to
 converge than the default mixing and Broyden mixing

 occupancies and the Fermi energy for q=0; the phonon dispersion for MgB2 is now

elk-2.3.16
-DFT+U now works with multiple entries per atom; every mention of LDA+U has now
 changed to DFT+U to reflect the generality of the method, and to give it an air
 of respectibility; for example, the block 'lda+u' is now 'dft+u'; old input
 files will still work fine
-greatly improved the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) calculations, thanks to
 suggestions by various users; the crystal is now rotated instead of the
 magnetisation direction
-fractional atomic species can now be generated on the fly using the 'fspecies'
 block; see the example 'fractional-species'; note that the atomic mass is only
 an estimate in these species files; this is useful for the virtual crystal

 Jagdish Kumar

 'bootstrap' kernel, which produces remarkably good linear optical response
 functions (article currently in preparation); see the example 'LiF-TDDFT'

 gap as a function of temperature; see the example 'Al-Eliashberg'
-improved the electron-phonon coupling calculation (task=240); this is faster,
 more accurate and now works for spin-spirals; now also parallelised with MPI

 format; this takes more memory, but is faster
-Anton Kozhevnikov fixed a small problem with calculating the nuclear-nuclear
 energy
-various optimisations, simplifications and minor bug fixes

 epsinv, have changed from (w,G,G') to (G,G',w)

elk-1.3.2
-linear response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) now available
 for calculating the q->0 dielectric response; see the example 'LiF-TDDFT'
 (experimental)
-fixed a problem with the BSE calculation which made the response function too
 large

 discussions with Markus Meinert; this enables the calulation of core state BSE
 spectra; see the example 'CaO-BSE-core' (experimental)
-MM also added an X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) example: 'Fe-XMCD'
-BSE calculations are now faster, thanks to discussions with MM

 has been implemented and also considerably speeds up OEP and RDMFT
-TMcQ also made some ongoing changes to the hybrid functional code
-made the radial Dirac and Schrodinger integrators yet more stable; thanks to AB
 and Frank Wagner for discussions
-fixed a problem with the ordinary RPA dielectric function; only affects
 calculations which have a scissor shift which made epsilon slightly too small
-real symmetric diagonalisation now used for the first-variational eigenvalue
 problem for crystals with inversion symmetry; this can speed up the calculation
 by a factor of three; this is thanks to discussions with Lars Nordstrom;
 Important: the atomic basis may be shifted to a different position and old
 output files may need to be reconverged
-fixed a stability problem which occurs when using GGA functionals by removing
 G-vector truncation of the effective potential introduced in version 1.0.16;
 thanks to Greg Walker for discovering this

 density matrix

 Alexei Baranov, Frank Wagner and Ondrej Certik for discussions)

-Simone Chiesa, Anton Kozhevnikov and Adolfo Eguiluz found a problem in the
 plotting of the partial DOS which has now been fixed

 non-packed storage mode: use 'tpmat=.false.'. This can speed up calculations at
 the expense of memory
-Tyrel McQueen found a bug in the 'findprim' routine, now fixed
-TMcQ also suggested a change to how the code connects the points of the
 'plot1d' vertices

 stored in the remaining part of the reduced k-point arrays

elk-1.1.4

 reciprocal space for bandstructure plots, 'connect.f90', which has been
 implemented
