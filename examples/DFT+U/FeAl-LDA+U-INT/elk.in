! FeAl in CsCl (B2) structure using LDA+U and interpolation between AMF and
! FLL double counting (dftu=3). Compare the total DOS and partial DOS with the
! one calculated with bare LDA. Note the opening of a gap and the increased
! localization of Fe d-electrons. Note the interpolation factor in file
! ALPHADU.OUT about 0.1, this  value is a sign of a weakly correlated compound
! (see PRB 67, 153106 (2003)).
! Example created by Fredrik Bultmark, Francesco Cricchio and Lars Nordstrom.
