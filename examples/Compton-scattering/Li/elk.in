! Once-integrated electron momentum density (EMD) plot for fcc Li.

! First the EMD is calculated on a regular H+k grid. This is then interpolated
! and integrated perpendicular to the plotting plane given by plot2d. The files
! required for plotting the EMD with OpenDX are included in this directory.

! Example by David Ernsting and Stephen Dugdale.
