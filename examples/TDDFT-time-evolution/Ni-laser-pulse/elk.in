! Simulation of an intense ultra-short laser pulse acting on fcc nickel.

! The laser pulse is represented by a time-dependent vector potential which is
! constructed from an arbitrary superposition of planes waves each multiplied
! with a Gaussian envelope function.

! The time-dependent vector potential and laser pulse parameters are written to
! AFIELDT.OUT and TD_INFO.OUT, respectively. The power density of the laser
! pulse is written to AFPDT.OUT. Time units are atomic, one of which is equal to
! 24.18884328 attoseconds.

! The total macroscopic current is written to the file CURRENT_TD.OUT and may be
! directly plotted. The total moment magnitude as a function of time is stored
! in the file MOMENTM_TD.OUT. Observe that the moment declines considerably
! after the laser pulse has stopped.

! This example is insufficiently converged for a production run, and all
! observables should be carefully checked for convergence with respect to the
! usual parameters.

! Simulation time step, ideally about 1 attosecond. It is critically important
! to make sure that the time evolution is stable, particularly for magnetism
! which can diverge even in the absence of a laser field. Any simulation should
! be run first with a laser field of amplitude zero to make sure that all
! observables remain constant over the total simulation time. Reducing the time
! step can improve stability.
