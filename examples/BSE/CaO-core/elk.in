! This example demonstrates the calculation of the Ca 2p 1/2 - 2p 3/2 (L2 / L3)
! x-ray absorption spectra in CaO. The Ca 2p states are treated as local
! orbitals in Ca_lo.in; additional local orbitals are added to allow an accurate
! description of the unoccupied 3d states (compare with the default version of Ca.in).

! Look at the imaginary part of the spectrum (EPSILON_BSE_11.OUT) in the range 11.8 to
! 12.5 Ha. Compare to the independent-particle calculation (EPSILON_11.OUT).
! Try switching off the exchange and the direct term in the BSE Hamiltonian
! individually (set hxbse/hdbse to .false.).

! For a converged spectrum a lot more k-points (6 x 6 x 6 or more) are needed.
! The numerical cut-offs are well converged, so the computation is quite time
! and memory consuming. Run with hybrid parallelization (MPI across nodes, OpenMP
! across cores) on a cluster for smaller memory footprint. Compare with calculations
! and experimental data in J. Phys. Condens. Matter 23, 145501 (2011).
