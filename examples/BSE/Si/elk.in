! BSE optical spectrum of silicon. Note that the non-zero vkloff is needed to
! make the system non-metallic, i.e. all occupancies in EIGVAL.OUT should be
! either 0 or 1. If this is not the case, then the response function will be
! too large. This is quite a time-consuming calculation and should be run on
! a multi-processor system.

! Silicon is surprisingly difficult for a BSE calculation: it requires quite a
! large k-point set for good convergence, unlike the excitonic peak in LiF.

tasks
  0         ! ground-state calculation
  120       ! compute momentum matrix elements
  121       ! compute RPA dielectric function with no local field contributions
  180       ! generate RPA dielectric function with local field contributions
  185       ! write the BSE Hamiltonian matrix to file
  186       ! diagonalise the BSE matrix
  187       ! compute BSE dielectric function

! this should be small (but not so small that it affects the results!) for a
! fast calculation because the wavefunctions used in the construction of the BSE
! matrix elements are expanded to this angular momentum cut-off
