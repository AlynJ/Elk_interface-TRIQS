! Unit cell optimisation for Ge with the PBE functional. This is performed with
! geometric optimisation in which the lattice vectors are changed.

! Setting 'latvopt' to 1 performs full unconstrained optimisation of the lattice
! vectors. Setting it to 2 results in an iso-volumetric optimisation. In both
! cases, the atomic positions are also optimised. To constrain the atomic
! positions, set the nuclear mass to be a negative number in the species file.

! As the calculation progresses, you can plot the files TOTENERGY_OPT.OUT and
! STRESSMAX.OUT to see the change in the total energy and stress tensor. The
! modulus of the maximum force on the atoms is written to FORCEMAX.OUT.

! The updated unit cell geometry is written to GEOMETRY_OPT.OUT. The last entry
! in this file contains the final lattice parameters and atomic positions.
