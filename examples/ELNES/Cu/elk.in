! Electron loss near-edge spectroscopy for fcc Cu. Note that a special species
! file has been constructed to simulate dynamical core-hole effects by removing
! half an electron from the 1s core state (even though we are interested in the
! 2s and 2p transitions). This is a publication-quality calculation and may take
! some time to complete.

! No supercell is required because of the strong metallic screening of copper.
! Compare with Eur. Phys. J. B21, 363 (2001).
