! Soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy example for bcc Fe, including XAS, XMCD,
! and XMLD. Species file Fe_lo.in has an additional local orbital at the 2p
! energy. Spin-orbit coupling has to be included for 2p 1/2 - 2p 3/2 splitting.
! XAS, XMCD, and XMLD are computed via first order optical response. Fe is
! cubic, hence the following relations hold for B || z:
!
! XAS = 1/3 * Im[ 2*eps_xx + eps_zz ] = 1/3 * Tr(Im[eps])
! XMCD = Im[ sigma_xy ] = -2*Re[ eps_xy ]
! XMLD = Im[ eps_xx - eps_zz ]
!
! Similarly, the real parts of the epsilon and sigma tensor are related to the
! Faraday effect. A much larger number of k-points is necessary for a well
! converged spectrum.
