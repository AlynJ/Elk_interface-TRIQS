! In this example, the frequency of a magnon at a particular q-vector in fcc Ni
! is determined. Computing a magnon frequency requires the energy difference,
! dE, between the ferromagnetic and a conical spin-spiral state with small polar
! angle theta. The following formula can then be used to compute the frequency:
!
!    w(q) = (4/M) dE / sin^2(theta)
!
! where M is the total moment in the unit cell. See Q. Niu and L. Kleinman,
! Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 2205 (1998). It is good practice to fix a q and then run
! two fixed spin direction calculations: one at theta=0, and the other at a
! finite theta (in this case 15 degrees).

! Note that the energy difference is very small (order of meV), and the
! calculation has to be very well converged in all parameters. As a result this
! example is best run on a multi-processor, and is still quite time-consuming.
