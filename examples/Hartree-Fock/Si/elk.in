! Hartree-Fock calculation of silicon. Note that this is still an experimental
! feature in Elk. It is also quite slow and is best run using OpenMP on a
! multi-processor machine.

! Important: the exact exchange energy is only calculated on the last iteration.
! All previously calculated exchange energies are approximate.

! Hartree-Fock is treated as a second-variational correction to the Kohn-Sham
! problem. Thus a large number of empty states are required for convergence.
