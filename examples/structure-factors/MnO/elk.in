! MnO in AFMII structure with LDA, in analogy with NiO example. Unit cell from
! Transactions and Journal of the British Ceramic Society (1984) 83, 5-9.
!
! This example illustrates the calculation of X-ray and magnetic structure
! factors  which are the Fourier transforms of the electron density and
! magnetisation, respectively.
!
! The structure factors are calculated for the reflections whose diffraction
! vectors have lengths up to hmaxvr (given in a.u.). The connection to the
! traditional sin(theta)/lambda ratio is
!
!      max|H| = 4*pi*max(sin(theta)/lambda)    [wavelength also in a.u.!]
!
! Additionally, the hkl indices of the reflections are transformed by matrix
! vhmat.
!
! Since the primitive magnetic unit cell (given by avec) is bigger than the
! conventional  crystallographic unit cell (cubic with a = 8.397946), a
! non-integer hkl indices appears when reflections are reindexed to the latter
! with vhmat. They have zero intensity for  X-ray structure factors but are of
! non-zero intensity in case of magnetic structure factors.
