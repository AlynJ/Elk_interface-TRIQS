! Calculating the Mossbauer effect hyperfine parameters for hcp Co, namely the
! contact charge density, the contact magnetic hyperfine field and the electric
! field gradient (EFG).

! The hyperfine magnetic field is difficult to calculate accurately. This is
! mainly because most of the contact magnetisation arises from the polarised
! core s states. One therefore has to switch on core polarisation with
! 'spincore=.true.', but in addition any semi-core s states should also be moved
! to the core and thus treated with the full Dirac equation. Also note that the
! field is quite sensitive to the number of empty states and k-points.

! Also note that the hyperfine field also depends strongly on the choice of
! functional with GGA functions usually yielding larger values. Try running the
! calculation again with PBE (xctype=20).

! Experimentally the hyperfine field is 21.9 Tesla [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 33, 1591
! (1972)].
