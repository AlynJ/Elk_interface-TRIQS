! Calculating the Mossbauer effect hyperfine parameters for bcc Fe, namely the
! contact charge density, the contact magnetic hyperfine field and the electric
! field gradient (EFG). In this case the EFG is zero because of symmetry.

! The hyperfine magnetic field is difficult to calculate accurately. This is
! partly due to the neglect of the orbital and dipolar contributions, but mainly
! because most of the contact magnetisation arises from the polarised core s
! states. One therefore has to switch on core polarisation with
! 'spincore=.true.', but in addition any semi-core s states should also be moved
! to the core and thus treated with the full Dirac equation. Consequently, this
! example requires a special species file (Fe.in), in which the 3s states are in
! the core. Note that the field is quite sensitive to the number of empty states
! and k-points.

! Also note that the hyperfine field also depends strongly on the choice of
! functional with GGA functions usually yielding larger values. Try running the
! calculation again with PBE (xctype=20).

! Experimentally the hyperfine field is 33.9 Tesla [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 33, 159
! (1972)]. A complete derivation of the formulae can be found in Phys. Rev. B
! 53, 3271 (1987).
