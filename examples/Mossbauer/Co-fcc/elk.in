! Calculating the Mossbauer effect hyperfine parameters for fcc Co, namely the
! contact charge density, the contact magnetic hyperfine field and the electric
! field gradient (EFG).

! The hyperfine magnetic field is difficult to calculate accurately. This is
! mainly because most of the contact magnetisation arises from the polarised
! core s states. One therefore has to switch on core polarisation with
! 'spincore=.true.', but in addition any semi-core s states should also be moved
! to the core and thus treated with the full Dirac equation. Also note that the
! field is quite sensitive to the number of empty states and k-points.

! Also note that the hyperfine field also depends strongly on the choice of
! functional, with GGA usually yielding larger values. Try running the
! calculation again with PBE (xctype=20). This may be the better choice of
! functional for Mossbauer related quantities because of the large density
! gradients near the nucleus.
