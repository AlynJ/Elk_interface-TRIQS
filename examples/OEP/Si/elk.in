! Optimised effective potential calculation of silicon. An iterative proceedure
! is used to find the optimised potential [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 196405 (2007)].
! Note that the exact exchange energy is calculated only during the last
! self-consistent loop, which is the reason why the final total energy is
! different from those calculated in previous loops.
