! Determination of the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) for Fe_(1-x)Co_x where
! x = 1/2 and the unit cell is tetragonal of L1_0 type.

! The MAE is determined from a set of fixed spin moment direction calculations
! performed automatically with task = 28. The number of direction points used is
! given by the parameter 'npmae'. The estimation becomes more accurate as the
! number of points increases, but the calculation takes longer. The MAE is also
! strongly dependent on the number of k-points, the number used in this example
! is insufficient for a reliable result.

! Example updated by James Glasbrenner and others.
