! Phonon spectrum and solving the Eliashberg equations to find the temperature-
! dependent superconducting gap. This example uses finite displacements and a
! supercell to determine the phonon modes.

! You can submit the same phonon job (task=200) on as many machines as you like,
! but they must be be able to see the same directory. Each machine will compute
! a row of a particular dynamical matrix. The code assembles all the pieces to
! construct the dynamical and electron-phonon coupling matrices throughout the
! Brillouin zone.

! Example by Antonio Sanna.
