! Phonon dispersion of silicon.

! You can submit the same job (with task=205) on as many machines as you like,
! but they must be be able to see the same directory. Each machine with compute
! a row of a particular dynamical matrix. When run with task=220, the code
! assembles all the pieces to construct the dynamical matrices throughout the
! Brillouin zone.

! The final output (PHDISP.OUT and PHDLINES.OUT) is included with this example.
